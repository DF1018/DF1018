# WHO AM Ôº©

##  I am DF, a programmer specializing in Python. I am currently devoted to researching Llama 2 and other Large Language Models (LLM).

# WHAT ARE YOU DO NOW

## I usually enjoy using web scraping technology to automatically obtain information about movies or comics I want to watch, gradually becoming proficient in HTML and Python scraping skills.

## At the moment, I am working hard to improve my algorithm and logic skills. You can visit my repositories to see my latest progress on LeetCode.
