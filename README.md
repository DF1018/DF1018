### https://github.com/DF1018/llama-langchain-public-version
### This is my project combining LangChain and Llama 2, and I've created both public and private versions. If you're interested, feel free to ask me for the private version.
### Although currently there's only a description in Traditional Chinese, I'll update it with an English version when I have time.

# WHAT ARE YOU DO NOW
### I usually enjoy using web scraping technology to automatically obtain information about movies or comics I want to watch, gradually becoming proficient in HTML and Python scraping skills.
